#Streamlit DNN Training and Regression Prediction App

This is a Deep Neural Network (DNN) training and regression prediction app developed by T. Shimokawa. The app utilizes Streamlit to provide a user-friendly interface for training a DNN and performing regression predictions.

#Features

User-friendly interface for training a DNN
Real-time visualization of training progress and validation loss
Prediction of regression values based on the trained model
Support for loading and saving trained models
Ability to customize hyperparameters and network architecture
Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

#Copy code

pip install -r requirements.txt

#Usage

To start the app, run the following command:

#arduino

Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Once the app is running, you can upload your training data and configure the DNN hyperparameters and architecture. After training the model, you can use the app to make regression predictions based on the trained model.
