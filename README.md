# **Streamlit DNN Training and Regression Prediction App**

This is a Deep Neural Network (DNN) training and regression prediction app developed by T. Shimokawa. The app utilizes Streamlit to provide a user-friendly interface for training a DNN and performing regression predictions.

# **Features**

User-friendly interface for training a DNN
Real-time visualization of training progress and validation loss
Prediction of regression values based on the trained model
Ability to customize hyperparameters and network architecture

## **Installation**
To install the necessary dependencies,
run the following command:

Copy code
~~~python
pip install -r requirements.txt
~~~

## **Usage**
To run the app, execute the following command:

Copy code
~~~python
streamlit run DNN_GUI_230326_temp.py
~~~
After launching the app, you can upload your training data and customize the hyperparameters and architecture of your DNN. While you cannot save your trained model using the app, you can use it to make regression predictions based on your trained model.

## **Author**
